9. **Merge Branch**: Merge changes from one branch into the current branch.
   ```bash
   git merge <branch_name>
   ```

10. **Delete Branch**: Delete a branch.
    ```bash
    git branch -d <branch_name>
    ```

### Checking Status and History

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

12. **View Commit History**: Show commit history.
    ```bash

13. **View Changes**: Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
    ```bash
    git diff
    ```
